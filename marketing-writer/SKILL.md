# Marketing Writer

Write marketing content that sounds like a real person, not a corporate marketing department.

## First: Understand the Product

Before writing ANY marketing content, explore the codebase to understand:

1. **What the app does** - Read README, main entry points, landing pages
2. **Core value proposition** - What problem does it solve? For whom?
3. **Key features** - What can users actually do?
4. **How it works** - Technical approach (simplified for marketing)

Use `view` to explore: README.md, package.json, main routes, landing/marketing pages, feature files.

If writing about a specific feature, find and read its implementation to understand what it actually does.

## Brand Voice Rules

**Do:**
- Write like you're texting a smart friend
- Get to the point fast
- Focus on what users GET, not what the product DOES
- Use "you" and "your" liberally
- Be specific (numbers, outcomes, real scenarios)

**Don't:**
- Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- Vague hype: "amazing", "incredible", "best-in-class"
- Feature lists without context
- Passive voice
- Exclamation points everywhere!!!

**Voice examples:**

Bad: "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform leverages cutting-edge technology to transform your workflow."

Good: "Stop copy-pasting between 5 different apps. This does it in one click."

Bad: "Experience the incredible power of our best-in-class solution!"

Good: "Saves me about 2 hours every Monday. Wish I found it sooner."

## Templates

### Landing Page Feature Section

Format: Problem → Solution → Benefit

```
[SECTION HEADLINE - states the outcome, not the feature]

[Problem - 1-2 sentences. The annoying thing they deal with now.]

[Solution - 1-2 sentences. What your feature does about it. Be specific.]

[Benefit - 1 sentence. The real-world result they get.]

[Optional: One concrete example or mini-testimonial style line]
```

**Example:**

```
Stop Forgetting What You Discussed

You had a great conversation last week. Now you can't remember what you agreed on. Sound familiar?

Every conversation gets auto-summarized with action items pulled out. Search across all your chats in seconds.

No more "wait, what did we decide about that?"
```

### Tweet Thread

Structure: Hook → Credibility → Value → CTA

```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
[Pattern interrupt or bold claim. Make them stop scrolling.]
[Optional: "Here's what I learned:" or "Thread 👇"]

Tweet 2-3 (Build credibility):
[Why should they listen? Personal experience, data, or problem you solved.]

Tweet 4-6 (Show value):
[Specific benefits. Each tweet = one clear point.]
[Use real numbers, timeframes, or outcomes when possible.]

Tweet 7 (CTA):
[Simple ask. Link. No pressure.]
```

**Example:**

```
Tweet 1:
I was mass-sending "personalized" emails that all sounded the same.

Then I automated it properly. Here's the setup:

Tweet 2:
The problem: Writing 50 custom emails takes forever. Templates feel fake.

I needed something that felt personal but didn't eat my whole day.

Tweet 3:
The fix: I feed it 3 bullet points about each person. It writes the email in my voice.

Takes 30 seconds per email instead of 10 minutes.

Tweet 4:
Results after 2 months:
- Response rate: 12% → 34%
- Time spent: 5 hrs/week → 45 min
- Actually enjoying outreach now (weird but true)

Tweet 5:
Try it: [link]

Free tier does 20 emails/month. Enough to see if it works for you.
```

### Launch Email

Structure: Personal → Value prop → Easy CTA

```
Subject: [Specific benefit or curiosity gap - no clickbait]

[Personal opener - 1-2 sentences. Why you built this or why you're reaching out.]

[The value prop - 2-3 sentences max. What it does and why they'd care.]

[One specific example or use case.]

[CTA - super low friction. One link, one action.]

[Sign off - keep it casual]

P.S. [Optional: secondary info, urgency, or personal note]
```

**Example:**

```
Subject: That thing you asked about is ready

Hey,

Remember when you mentioned wishing you could [specific problem]? Built something for it.

[Product] lets you [core action] without [main pain point]. Most people set it up in under 5 minutes.

One user told me it saved them from "yet another spreadsheet nightmare" - their words.

## Writing Checklist

Before finishing any marketing content, verify:

- [ ] Would I actually say this to a friend?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place?
- [ ] Did I cut the corporate fluff?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear in the first 10 words?
- [ ] Would someone know what to do next?

## Adapting to Context

**For technical audiences:** You can use more specific terminology, but still avoid marketing-speak. Technical people especially hate hype.

**For broader audiences:** Simpler language, more focus on outcomes over features.

**For existing users:** Skip the "what it is" - go straight to "what's new and why you'd care."

**For cold outreach:** Shorter is better. Prove value fast or you've lost them.
